      "Prepared by: Arush Khare\n",
      "May 2, 2025\n",
      "Executive Summary\n",
      "Carnegie Mellon University is a world-class institution with a very strong Computer Science\n",
      "program. To further increase Carnegie Mellon University’s excellence in Computer Science, I\n",
      "propose that Dietrich College create an online hackathon for its students. Hackathons are\n",
      "events that allow students to collaborate with each other to develop technology-based\n",
      "solutions to issues relating to the event’s topic. Hackathons are known for promoting\n",
      "interdisciplinary collaboration. Interdisciplinary collaboration allows students to gain new\n",
      "perspectives on issues, which can lead to innovative solutions that address those issues.\n",
      "Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration broadens students’ knowledge of their disciplines.\n",
      "Research shows that online hackathons can be implemented with low cost and short planning\n",
      "times. The main costs are the systems and software needed to support the online hackathons.\n",
      "Benefits of the online hackathon will be that Dietrich College students will be able to engage in\n",
      "interdisciplinary collaboration with students from other disciplines and CMU colleges. This will\n",
      "strengthen Dietrich undergrads’ knowledge of their fields of study.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Interdisciplinary Collaboration\n",
      "Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial in today’s world. It provides students new perspectives\n",
      "on critical issues, allowing them to find effective solutions to those problems. Additionally,\n",
      "interdisciplinary collaboration allows for students to broaden their field of study to other\n",
      "disciplines. Interdisciplinary collaboration also allows students to work with technology,\n",
      "allowing them to gain valuable knowledge on applications of technology to their disciplines.\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon University, interdisciplinary collaboration enables students to work on\n",
      "innovative and impactful research and projects. For example, students in Computer Science are\n",
      "working with experts in Psychology and Arts to conduct research in Human-Computer\n",
      "Interaction. Another example is that students studying Statistics take Machine Learning courses\n",
      "to learn how to work with advanced technologies for modeling and analysis. These courses\n",
      "allow students to explore other fields and gain experience with technology.\n",
      "Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences\n",
      "Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences is a college within Carnegie Mellon\n",
      "University. It is home to majors and departments such as Statistics and Machine Learning,\n",
      "Philosophy, English, History, Psychology, and more. It is home to over 1500 undergraduate and\n",
      "350 graduate students. Dietrich College has some projects with the School of Computer Science\n",
      "through departments such as Statistics and Data Science, Social and Decision Sciences, and\n",
      "many others.\n",
      "Problem\n",
      "While Dietrich College has some opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, most of them\n",
      "are tailored toward graduate students. Thus, the nearly 1500 undergraduate students do not\n",
      "have many opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with Computer Science\n",
      "students. Since Computer Science is prevalent in today’s world, this means that Dietrich\n",
      "students may miss out on opportunities to learn about the field and apply it to their fields.\n",
      "Lack of Knowledge of Programs\n",
      "To add to this issue, many Dietrich undergraduates do not know much about opportunities for\n",
      "interdisciplinary collaboration within their own college. For example, in a survey I conducted\n",
      "with Dietrich students (attached in Appendix), I found that 40% of those students stated that\n",
      "they did not know any programs within Dietrich College that allowed for interdisciplinary\n",
      "collaboration. Of the 60% who said that they knew about such programs, a third of them were\n",
      "not fully sure about the programs. This means that any existing interdisciplinary collaboration\n",
      "opportunities for undergraduate students in Dietrich College may be underutilized, making\n",
      "them ineffective in promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.\n",
      "Impact of Problem\n",
      "Without many undergraduate interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities between Dietrich\n",
      "College and the School of Computer Science, Dietrich College students may struggle to find\n",
